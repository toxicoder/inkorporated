# General Rules

This file activates core rules that apply to all projects.

## Core Guidelines

These are fundamental rules that should be applied across all projects:

- Follow the project's established code style and patterns
- Maintain consistent documentation practices
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Keep dependencies up to date and secure
- Follow security best practices in all implementations
- Ensure code is maintainable and readable
- Document architecture decisions clearly
- Follow version control best practices
- Monitor and optimize performance
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Support internationalization from the start
- **Leverage Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools and servers to enhance development capabilities and automate repetitive tasks**
- **Prioritize MCP-based solutions for external integrations, research tasks, and AI-assisted development workflows**
- **Integrate MCP tools systematically into development workflows to enhance productivity, code quality, and maintainability**
- **Utilize context7 MCP server to retrieve documentation and code patterns for implementation assistance**
- **Apply MCP principles to infrastructure automation and configuration management**
- **Use MCP servers for GitOps deployment validation and monitoring**
- **Implement MCP-based security scanning for infrastructure components**
- **Leverage MCP for automated backup and restore procedures**
- **Integrate MCP tools for service discovery and health monitoring**
