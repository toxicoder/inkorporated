- Pin dependency versions in package files
- Review licenses of all dependencies
- Use lock files to ensure reproducible builds
- Regularly audit for outdated or vulnerable packages
- Prefer stable, well-maintained libraries
- Document rationale for adding new dependencies
- Remove unused dependencies promptly
- Group dependencies by dev/prod
- Use peer dependencies appropriately
- Automate dependency updates with bots
- Test dependencies in isolation
- Avoid transitive dependency issues
- Use monorepo tools if multi-package
- Document dependency graph
- Prefer minimal dependencies
- Use aliases for path resolutions
- Monitor dependency sizes
- **Use MCP tools for dependency analysis and security scanning**
- **Integrate MCP-based dependency monitoring into workflows**
