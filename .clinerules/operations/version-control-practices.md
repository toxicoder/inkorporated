# Version Control Practices

## Version Control Practices

- Use semantic versioning for releases
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits format
- Branch naming: feature/xxx, bugfix/yyy, hotfix/zzz
- Rebase feature branches before merging
- Protect main branch; require pull request reviews
- Tag releases with version numbers
- Avoid committing large binary files; use .gitignore appropriately
- Use git hooks for pre-commit checks
- Squash commits before merging PRs
- Include issue references in commit messages
- Maintain a clean commit history
- Use cherry-pick for backporting fixes
- Set up branch protection rules
- Use signed commits for security
- Archive old branches after merges
- Use git submodules for shared libraries if needed
- Document branching strategy in docs
