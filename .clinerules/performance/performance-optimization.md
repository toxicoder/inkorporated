# Performance Optimization

## Performance Optimization

- Profile code for bottlenecks before optimizing
- Use caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries with indexes
- Minimize bundle sizes for frontend assets
- Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- Monitor performance metrics in production
- Avoid blocking operations in main threads
- Use efficient data structures for algorithms
- Batch database operations
- Use web workers for heavy computations
- Optimize images and assets
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Use CDNs for static files
- Minimize DOM manipulations in UI
- Profile memory usage
- Use throttling and debouncing for events
- Optimize network requests
- Implement server-side rendering where beneficial
- **Consider MCP tools for performance profiling and optimization analysis**
- **Use MCP-based monitoring and analytics for performance insights**
