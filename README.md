# devset

## Project Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of development tools, templates, and best practices for initializing and maintaining code repositories. It provides a standardized foundation for projects to ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to provide developers with:
- A complete set of documentation templates and standards
- Automated workflows for common development tasks
- Standardized project structures and configurations
- Cline memory bank and rule systems for AI-assisted development
- Dev container configurations for consistent development environments
- Post-fork setup automation for maintaining proper attribution

## Use Pattern

This repository is designed to be used as a template/reference:
1. Developers start with their existing git repository
2. They download/clone the files from this repository into their project
3. The files are then maintained separately in each individual project
4. Each project can customize and extend the templates as needed

## Key Components

### Memory Bank System
- `memory-bank/` - Core documentation files for project context
- `clinerules-bank/` - Standard rules and guidelines
- `clines-memory-bank-rule.md` - Documentation of the memory bank system

### Workflow Collection
- `workflows/` - Automation workflows for various development tasks
- Includes initialization, maintenance, and operational workflows
- Each workflow is documented with parameters and steps

### Dev Container Configuration
- `.devcontainer/` - VS Code dev container setup
- Pre-configured with common development tools and extensions
- Ensures consistent development environments

### Technical Documentation
- `docs/technical_design_doc.md` - Template for technical design documents
- Standardized format for project documentation

## How to Use

1. Clone or fork this repository
2. Copy the desired files into your existing project
3. Customize the templates to match your specific project needs
4. Maintain the files separately in your project repository
5. Use the workflows for automated task execution

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Standardized templates across projects
- **Efficiency**: Pre-built workflows reduce setup time
- **Quality**: Established rules and guidelines improve code quality
- **Maintainability**: Clear documentation and structure
- **Collaboration**: Shared standards facilitate team development
