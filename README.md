# Inkorporated - Eazy Homelab & Corp IaC

[![Inkorporated banner](static/images/inkorporated-globe-banner.jpg)]()

## Overview

This repository contains the complete infrastructure-as-code for the Inkorporated homelab, a comprehensive self-hosted, open-source internal work environment designed for homelab deployments. It provides a complete, integrated solution that combines infrastructure automation, GitOps deployment, and a rich set of productivity and collaboration tools.

## Architecture

Inkorporated now supports a **Hybrid Cloud** architecture, enabling workloads to run on both on-premises Proxmox clusters and public cloud providers (AWS, GCP).

*   **Proxmox**: Hosts the core control plane and persistent workloads.
*   **Public Cloud (AWS/GCP)**: Used for burst capacity and temporary workloads.
*   **Networking**: Hybrid nodes are connected via VPN (Tailscale/Wireguard - *implementation detail*).
*   **Storage**:
    *   On-Prem: Longhorn / NFS
    *   Cloud: Cloud-native storage (e.g., gp2/standard)

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed diagrams and topology.

## Project Structure

The Inkorporated project is organized into several key areas:

- **Infrastructure as Code**:
    - `infrastructure/terraform`: Modular Terraform for Hybrid Cloud provisioning (Proxmox, AWS, GCP).
    - `infrastructure/ansible`: Ansible roles for hybrid k3s setup (LXC, VMs, Cloud).
- **GitOps Deployment**: ArgoCD for declarative infrastructure and application management using ApplicationSets.
- **Zero-trust Access**: Cloudflare Tunnel for secure external access
- **Centralized Authentication**: Authentik SSO/OIDC integration
- **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki stack
- **Storage Solutions**: Longhorn and NFS CSI driver
- **Backup & Recovery**: Velero with MinIO
- **Service Mesh**: Traefik with forward-auth middleware
- **Version Control**: Gitea instance for GitOps workflow
- **CI/CD**: Gitea runners for automated deployments

## Deployment Patterns

All services follow a consistent deployment pattern:
1. Create Namespace
2. Create Core Deployment with appropriate resources
3. Create Service
4. Create PodDisruptionBudget (where applicable)
5. Create ConfigMap (where applicable)
6. Create Ingress (where applicable)
7. Create Secrets (where applicable)

## Configuration Management

The project implements a centralized configuration management system that separates sensitive credentials from main settings:

- **Main Settings File**: `cline_mcp_settings.json` - Contains server configurations and settings (no sensitive data)
- **Configuration File**: `.devcontainer/.env` - Contains sensitive credentials and environment-specific settings (not version controlled)
- **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Different files for different environments (`.devcontainer/.env.dev`, `.devcontainer/.env.staging`, `.devcontainer/.env.prod`)

## Environment Structure

The repository now supports multiple environments with dedicated configuration directories:

- `config/environments/` - Environment-specific configurations
- `apps/environments/` - Environment-specific application overrides

### Supported Environments
1. **dev** - Development environment
2. **staging** - Staging environment
3. **autopush** - Autopush environment
4. **uat** - User Acceptance Testing environment
5. **canary** - Canary environment for feature testing
6. **prod** - Production environment
7. **priv** - Private environment for sensitive services

## Security Approach

The configuration system follows security best practices:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Sensitive credentials are separated from settings
2. **Version Control Safety**: No sensitive data is committed to version control
3. **File Permissions**: Config files are secured with restrictive permissions (600)
4. **Environment Variables**: Configuration loaded at runtime
5. **Zero-trust Architecture**: Cloudflare Tunnel for external access
6. **Centralized Authentication**: Authentik for SSO
7. **Network Segmentation**: pfSense firewall with VLANs

## Integration Patterns

### Authentication Flow
1. User accesses any service via subdomain (e.g., `https://chat.example.com`)
2. Traefik forwards request to Authentik for authentication
3. Authentik validates credentials and issues JWT
4. User is redirected back to service with authenticated session
5. Service validates JWT and grants access

### Data Flow
1. Services communicate through internal Kubernetes networks
2. External services use Cloudflare Tunnel for secure access
3. All data is encrypted in-transit using TLS
4. Persistent data stored on Longhorn volumes or MinIO

## Maintenance and Operations

- Regular security audits and updates
- Automated container image updates
- Monitoring and alerting review
- Backup testing and verification
- Performance optimization
- Documentation updates
