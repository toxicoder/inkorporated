## Job Description
The Data Engineer is responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure required for optimal extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data from a wide variety of data sources using SQL and 'big data' technologies. They design and construct data pipelines, data lakes, and data warehouses that enable data scientists and business analysts to derive insights. They ensure data quality, reliability, and efficiency.

## Responsibilities

*   **Pipeline Development:** Design, build, and maintain scalable data pipelines to ingest and process data from various sources (APIs, databases, logs). You use tools like Airflow or Prefect to orchestrate these workflows, ensuring that dependencies are managed correctly and retries are handled automatically. You ensure that pipelines are robust and can handle failures gracefully without data loss or corruption. You optimize the pipeline for latency and throughput, ensuring that data arrives in the warehouse in a timely manner for downstream consumption. You implement monitoring and alerting to detect pipeline failures immediately.
*   **Data Modeling:** Design and implement data models for data warehouses and data marts that support complex analytical queries. You understand the trade-offs between different schemas (Star, Snowflake, Vault) and choose the right one for the use case. You ensure that the data is organized in a way that is easy to query and analyze for business users. You maintain comprehensive data dictionaries and documentation to help users understand the data lineage and definitions. You constantly refine the models as business requirements evolve.
*   **Data Warehouse Management:** Manage and optimize cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) to ensure high performance and cost efficiency. You monitor query performance and implement optimizations like clustering, partitioning, and materialized views. You manage user access and compute resources to control costs and prevent resource contention. You ensure the warehouse is available and performant even during peak load times. You implement backup and recovery strategies to protect critical data.
*   **Data Quality and Governance:** Implement automated checks and validation steps to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and completeness. You set up alerts for data anomalies, null values, and schema drift to catch issues before they impact downstream reports. You ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) by implementing masking and access controls. You are the custodian of data integrity and work to establish a culture of data quality. You audit data usage to ensure compliance with internal policies.
*   **ETL/ELT Processes:** Develop and maintain ETL/ELT processes to transform raw data into a usable format for analysis. You use SQL and programming languages like Python or Scala to perform complex transformations and cleaning. You decide when to perform transformations (before or after loading) based on the volume and velocity of the data. You ensure transformations are idempotent, testable, and version-controlled. You optimize transformation logic to minimize compute costs.
*   **Big Data Technologies:** Work with big data frameworks like Spark or Flink for processing massive datasets that don't fit in a traditional database. You tune these jobs for performance and resource usage to ensure they complete within SLAs. You choose the right tool for the job (batch vs. streaming) based on the latency requirements. You manage the underlying infrastructure (e.g., EMR, Databricks) and ensure it scales with the data volume. You stay updated on the latest advancements in the big data ecosystem.
*   **Streaming Data:** Design and build real-time data streaming solutions using Kafka or Kinesis for low-latency use cases. You ensure low-latency delivery of data for real-time analytics, fraud detection, and operational monitoring. You handle complex issues like out-of-order events, deduplication, and exactly-once processing. You integrate streaming data with batch data to provide a unified view of the business. You ensure the streaming infrastructure is highly available and fault-tolerant.
*   **Collaboration:** Work closely with Data Scientists and Data Analysts to understand their data needs and provide them with the right datasets. You help them optimize their queries and access the data they need efficiently. You collaborate with Backend Engineers to define data schemas and events at the source. You act as a bridge between data producers and consumers, translating technical constraints into business value. You provide training and support to data users.
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Manage the data infrastructure using code (Terraform, CloudFormation) to ensure consistency and reproducibility. You ensure that the infrastructure is reproducible and version-controlled, allowing for easy rollback and disaster recovery. You automate the deployment of data resources to reduce manual toil and error. You manage environments (dev, staging, prod) to ensure safe testing and deployment of changes. You enforce security best practices in the infrastructure configuration.
*   **Tool Evaluation:** Continuously evaluate new data tools and technologies to improve the efficiency and capabilities of the data platform. You conduct Proof of Concepts (POCs) to determine if a tool fits the company's needs and integrates well with the existing stack. You make recommendations on the data stack roadmap based on your findings. You stay up to date with the rapidly evolving data landscape to keep the company competitive. You balance the benefits of new technology with the cost of migration.

## Average Daily Tasks
*   **09:00 AM - Standup:** Join the data team standup to discuss progress and blockers. I report that the nightly batch jobs finished successfully and that the data is ready for the analysts. I mention that I'm working on the new marketing attribution pipeline today and might need some input on the schema. I listen to the other engineers to see if there are any shared challenges or dependencies. I flag that I need a code review for my PR from yesterday.
*   **09:30 AM - Pipeline Monitoring:** I check the Airflow dashboard for any failed tasks or delayed DAGs. I see a failure in the ingestion job from the CRM API due to a rate limit error. I analyze the logs to confirm the issue and restart the task with a modified backoff strategy. I make a note to update the rate limiting logic in the code to prevent this from happening again. I verify that the downstream dependencies are paused until the fix works.
*   **10:00 AM - Code Development:** I write a Python script to extract data from a new third-party API for the marketing team. I handle pagination, authentication, and error handling to ensure robust extraction. I write unit tests to verify the data extraction logic and ensure it handles edge cases like empty responses. I run the script locally to verify the output format matches the requirements. I commit the code to a feature branch.
*   **12:00 PM - Lunch:** I grab lunch and read a blog post about the new features in Snowflake's latest release. I think about how we could use the new features to optimize our current storage costs. I chat with a colleague about a new open-source tool for data quality. I take a short walk to clear my head. I return to my desk refreshed.
*   **01:00 PM - Data Modeling:** I meet with a Data Analyst to discuss the schema for a new reporting table they need for a dashboard. We decide on a denormalized structure (One Big Table) to improve query performance and simplify their SQL. I draft the `CREATE TABLE` statement and review the column data types with them. We discuss the partition key strategy to ensure the queries remain fast as the data grows. I document the schema in the data dictionary.
*   **02:00 PM - Code Review:** I review a pull request from a colleague who is adding a new dbt model for finance reporting. I check the SQL logic to ensure it calculates the metrics correctly and handles null values safely. I ensure that the documentation in the YAML file is updated and clear. I suggest an index optimization to speed up the model build time. I approve the PR once my comments are addressed.
*   **03:00 PM - Infrastructure Work:** I update the Terraform configuration to add a new S3 bucket for storing raw logs from the web server. I run `terraform plan` to verify the changes and ensure no existing resources will be destroyed. I apply the changes to the dev environment first to test the permissions. I verify that the application can write to the new bucket. I create a PR to promote the changes to production.
*   **04:00 PM - Ad-hoc Request:** A Product Manager asks why the user count on the main dashboard looks low compared to yesterday. I investigate the data lineage and find a delay in the upstream event stream from the mobile app. I communicate the issue to the PM and the mobile team, providing an ETA for the fix. I trigger a backfill once the upstream issue is resolved to correct the data. I verify the dashboard numbers are correct.
*   **05:00 PM - Optimization:** I spend some time tuning a slow-running Spark job that processes user activity logs. I analyze the execution plan and adjust the memory allocation and the number of executors. I realize there is data skew and modify the partitioning key to distribute the load more evenly. I verify that the job runs 30% faster and uses fewer resources. I document the optimization technique for the team.
*   **05:30 PM - Wrap-up:** I commit my code changes and check the status of the pipelines one last time before leaving. I update the Jira tickets with the progress I made today. I check my calendar for tomorrow's meetings. I clean up any temporary files in my local environment. I head out for the evening.

### Personalities
*   **The Pipeline Plumber:** Focuses on the flow of data from source to destination. This persona is obsessed with reliability, retries, and error handling. They view data pipelines as critical infrastructure that must never fail silently. They are always monitoring DAG execution times and backfill progress. They know exactly which pipe is leaking when the dashboard goes blank.
*   **The Data Architect:** Thinks in terms of schemas, normalization, and data modeling. They ensure that the data warehouse is organized logically and efficiently for querying. They advocate for strict typing and clean data dictionaries. They are the gatekeepers of the "single source of truth." They can explain the trade-offs between Star and Snowflake schemas in detail.

They are always looking for ways to partition data better and prune unnecessary partitions. They treat compute resources as a precious commodity. They get excited about query plans and vectorization.
*   **The Quality Controller:** Paranoid about bad data entering the system, this persona implements rigorous testing and validation steps. They set up alerts for null values, schema drift, and unexpected data distributions. They believe that "garbage in, garbage out" is the cardinal sin of data engineering. They stop the pipeline rather than letting bad data downstream.
*   **The Tool Integrator:** Loves exploring the modern data stack. They are always evaluating new tools for orchestration, cataloging, and observability. They work to stitch together disparate systems into a cohesive data platform. They are the bridge between legacy on-prem systems and the cloud.

### Example Phrases
*   **Schema Mismatch Alert:** "The nightly ETL job failed due to a schema mismatch; I need to update the parser. It looks like the upstream team added a new field to the JSON payload without notifying us, causing our strict validation to throw an error. I'll patch the schema definition and re-run the pipeline from the point of failure. We really need to enforce contract testing to prevent this in the future."
*   **Partitioning Strategy:** "We should partition this table by date to speed up the historical analysis queries. Currently, every query is scanning the entire dataset, which is inefficient and costing us a fortune in compute credits. By partitioning by `created_at`, the query engine can skip over files that aren't relevant to the time range being analyzed. This should drop query times from minutes to seconds."
*   **ELT Optimization:** "This transformation is taking too long; let's push the computation down to the warehouse using dbt. Processing this in Python on a single machine is the bottleneck; Snowflake's distributed compute engine can handle this join much faster. We can rewrite this logic in SQL and let the warehouse do the heavy lifting. This fits better with our ELT philosophy."
*   **Data Drift Detection:** "I'm detecting some data drift in the source system; we need to alert the backend team. The distribution of the 'user_age' column has shifted significantly in the last 24 hours, with a spike in null values. This could indicate a bug in the signup flow or a bot attack. We should pause the model training pipeline until we verify the data integrity."
*   **Privacy Compliance:** "We need to ensure PII is masked before this data lands in the analytics environment. Emails and phone numbers must be hashed or tokenized so that analysts can perform matching without seeing the raw values. This is a strict requirement for GDPR compliance. I'll add a masking transformation step to the ingestion pipeline."
*   **CDC Implementation:** "Let's use a change data capture (CDC) pattern to stream updates instead of doing full batch loads. Querying the entire database every hour puts too much load on the production OLTP system. By reading the transaction logs (WAL), we can get real-time updates with minimal impact. This will also give us the ability to see the history of changes."
*   **Materialization:** "The cost of this query is too high; let's materialize the intermediate results as a table. Multiple dashboards are running this same complex aggregation every time they load. By pre-calculating the summary statistics and storing them, we can serve the dashboards instantly and save compute. We can set up a scheduled job to refresh the materialized view hourly."
*   **Backfill Necessity:** "We need to backfill the data for the last month because of that logic bug in the currency conversion step. The historic data shows incorrect revenue figures, which will mess up the quarterly report. I've corrected the code, and now I'll spin up a separate cluster to re-process the raw logs for that period. I'll verify the totals match the source of truth before swapping the tables."
*   **Dependency Management:** "I'm setting up a sensor in Airflow to wait for the S3 file before triggering the next task. We can't rely on the file arriving exactly at 2 AM every day due to network variability. The sensor will poll the bucket and only proceed once the data is present. This avoids those false negative failure alerts."
*   **JSON Flattening:** "This JSON structure is too nested for easy analysis; we should flatten it during ingestion. Analysts shouldn't have to parse JSON arrays in SQL every time they want to count items. I'll explode the array into separate rows and extract the keys into their own columns. This will make the table much more user-friendly."
