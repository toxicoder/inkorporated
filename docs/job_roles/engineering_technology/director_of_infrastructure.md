## Job Description
The Director of Infrastructure leads the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), DevOps, and Security teams. They are responsible for the stability, scalability, and security of the company's platform. They manage the cloud budget, vendor relationships, and 24/7 on-call operations. They build the "Golden Path" for developers, ensuring that shipping code is fast, safe, and reliable. They are the guardian of production.

## Responsibilities

You establish Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Error Budgets with product teams to balance speed and stability. You oversee the incident management process and ensure rigorous, blameless post-mortems are conducted. You drive architectural changes to eliminate single points of failure and improve resilience. You monitor reliability metrics daily.
*   **Cloud Strategy and Budget:** Manage the strategic relationship with cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure). You optimize cloud costs through reserved instances, rightsizing, and architectural tuning to prevent waste. You define the multi-cloud or hybrid strategy to mitigate vendor lock-in risks. You ensure the company is getting the best value for its infrastructure spend through regular audits. You forecast infrastructure costs for annual planning.
*   **Security and Compliance:** Partner with the CISO or lead the security function to ensure the platform is secure by design. You oversee SOC 2, HIPAA, or other compliance audits and ensure all controls are met. You ensure that security is "shifted left" into the development process through automation. You manage vulnerability scanning and penetration testing schedules. You ensure data encryption standards are applied.
*   **Platform Engineering:** Build and maintain the internal developer platform (IDP) to reduce cognitive load for developers. You provide self-service tools for developers to provision infrastructure safely and quickly. You manage the Kubernetes clusters, CI/CD pipelines, and observability stack. You measure success by developer productivity and satisfaction scores. You treat the platform as a product.

You define the career ladder for the infrastructure organization to ensure growth opportunities. You ensure a healthy on-call rotation that prevents burnout and fatigue. You foster a culture of automation and operational excellence.
*   **Incident Management:** Oversee the response to major production incidents and act as the ultimate point of escalation. You ensure that communication with stakeholders is clear, timely, and accurate during outages. You drive the "action items" from post-mortems to completion to prevent recurrence. You conduct regular incident drills to prepare the team. You manage the on-call schedule and tooling.
*   **Disaster Recovery:** Define and test the Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity Plan (BCP). You ensure that backups are reliable and that the team can restore service within the RTO/RPO targets. You conduct regular "Game Days" to practice failure scenarios and validate recovery procedures. You ensure geographic redundancy for critical systems. You document recovery runbooks.
*   **Vendor Management:** Negotiate contracts with SaaS vendors (Datadog, PagerDuty, etc.) to get the best pricing. You evaluate new tools and manage the procurement process to ensure they meet requirements. You ensure that the toolchain is integrated and effective for the team. You consolidate redundant tools to save costs and reduce complexity. You manage vendor relationships and support tickets.
*   **Performance Engineering:** oversee the performance of the platform to ensure a fast user experience. You ensure that latency is low and throughput is high even under load. You work with development teams to optimize database queries and code performance. You plan for capacity ahead of peak traffic events like sales or launches. You implement caching strategies to improve speed.
*   **Strategic Planning:** Define the 3-year infrastructure roadmap to support business growth. You anticipate future scaling needs and technology trends to keep the platform modern. You decide when to adopt new technologies (e.g., Serverless, WASM) and when to stick with proven solutions. You align infrastructure goals with business objectives and product roadmaps. You communicate the strategy to the executive team.

### Example Phrases
*   **Cost Savings:** "We need to reserve more instances to cut costs. Our on-demand spend is 60% of the bill, which is unacceptable for steady-state workloads. If we buy 1-year RIs, we save 40% immediately. I'll get finance approval today. We can reinvest the savings into R&D."
*   **Incident Awareness:** "The latency in us-east-1 is spiking; check the status page. It looks like an upstream AWS issue with DynamoDB. Let's failover to us-west-2 immediately. Update the status page to let customers know we are mitigating. We need to communicate proactively."
*   **Security Enforcement:** "Who authorized this security group change? Opening port 22 to 0.0.0.0 is a critical violation of our security policy. I'm reverting this change now. We need to audit who has write access to the networking stack. This cannot happen again."
*   **IaC Adoption:** "We are migrating to Terraform for better state management. The current CloudFormation templates are unmanageable and drifting. We need to import existing resources and enforce a PR workflow for all infra changes. No more ClickOps. Infrastructure must be versioned."
*   **Post-Mortem Culture:** "Let's review the post-mortem from the outage. I see 'human error' listed as the root cause. That's not a root cause. Why did the system allow a human to make that error? We need to build a guardrail, not blame a person. We need to learn from this."
*   **Container Security:** "Is this container running as root? That's a security risk. If the container is compromised, they have root on the host. We need to enforce a `runAsNonRoot` policy in our Kubernetes admission controller. Fix it before deployment. Security is non-negotiable."
*   **High Availability:** "We need multi-region failover. Currently, if us-east-1 goes down, we are down. We need to replicate our database to a secondary region and practice the failover procedure. It's an insurance policy for the business. The cost of downtime exceeds the cost of redundancy."
*   **Pipeline Performance:** "The CI pipeline is too slow. Developers are waiting 40 minutes for feedback. We need to parallelize the tests and cache the Docker layers. Time is money. I want to see this under 10 minutes. Fast feedback loops are essential."
*   **Key Management:** "Did we rotate the keys? The credential rotation policy says every 90 days. We are at day 100. We need to automate this process so we don't have to rely on calendar reminders. Let's use Vault. Manual rotation is a security risk."
*   **Disaster Recovery:** "What's the RTO and RPO for this service? The business expectation is 15 minutes data loss max. Our current backup schedule runs every 24 hours. We need to switch to point-in-time recovery (PITR) to meet the SLA. We need to test the restore process."
