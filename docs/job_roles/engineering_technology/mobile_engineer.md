## Job Description
The Mobile Engineer builds the company's native applications for iOS and Android. They are responsible for delivering a high-quality, performant, and native mobile experience. They work with the same constraints as web developers but with the added complexity of device fragmentation, app store guidelines, and limited resources (battery, data).

## Responsibilities

*   **App Development:** Design and build advanced applications for the iOS or Android platform (or both via React Native/Flutter). You write clean, maintainable, and efficient code using Swift, Kotlin, or Dart. You ensure the app adheres to platform-specific design guidelines (Human Interface Guidelines / Material Design) to provide a native feel. You stay up-to-date with the latest language features and best practices. You optimize the codebase for readability and reusability.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Ensure the best possible performance, quality, and responsiveness of the application. You optimize for battery life, memory usage, and network efficiency to respect user resources. You profile the app using tools like Instruments or Android Profiler to find and fix frame drops and slow startups. You ensure smooth scrolling and animations even on older devices. You monitor app size to keep it within reasonable limits for download.
*   **Feature Implementation:** Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design, and ship new features. You translate product requirements into native mobile experiences that delight users. You integrate with backend APIs and third-party SDKs to provide rich functionality. You handle offline support and data synchronization to ensure the app works in all network conditions. You participate in sprint planning to estimate effort.
*   **Code Quality and Testing:** Unit-test code for robustness, including edge cases, usability, and general reliability. You maintain a high level of code coverage to prevent regressions and ensure stability. You use automated testing tools (XCTest, Espresso, Detox) to validate critical user flows. You participate in code reviews to maintain high standards and share knowledge. You write documentation for complex logic.
*   **Bug Fixing:** Identify and correct bottlenecks and fix bugs to improve application stability. You use crash reporting tools (Sentry, Crashlytics) to monitor app stability in the wild and prioritize fixes. You reproduce complex issues reported by users by simulating different environments. You investigate ANRs (Application Not Responding) and crashes deep in the stack trace. You release hotfixes for critical production issues.
*   **App Store Management:** Manage the entire app lifecycle, from development to release on the App Store and Google Play. You handle certificates, provisioning profiles, and store listings to ensure a smooth submission process. You ensure the app meets all review guidelines to avoid rejections. You manage beta testing using TestFlight or Google Play Console to get early feedback. You track app store metrics and ratings.
*   **Platform Updates:** Continuously discover, evaluate, and implement new technologies to maximize development efficiency. You keep up with the latest OS versions (iOS 18, Android 15) and adapt the app to support new features. You update the app to support new device form factors like foldables or dynamic islands. You migrate away from deprecated APIs to ensure long-term maintainability. You experiment with new frameworks like SwiftUI or Jetpack Compose.
*   **Offline Experience:** Architect the app to work seamlessly with intermittent network connectivity. You implement local databases (CoreData, Room, Realm) for caching data and enabling offline access. You design robust sync mechanisms to resolve conflicts between local and server data. You ensure the user can still perform core actions offline and sync later. You handle network transitions gracefully.
*   **UI/UX Implementation:** Work closely with designers to implement custom UI components and complex interactions. You ensure the app feels "native" and responsive to touch input. You handle dark mode, dynamic type, and different screen sizes to support all users. You implement accessible interfaces that work with VoiceOver and TalkBack. You verify the implementation against design specs.
*   **Security:** Implement mobile security best practices to protect user data and preventing unauthorized access. You ensure secure storage of sensitive data using the Keychain or Keystore. You implement certificate pinning to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. You obfuscate code to prevent reverse engineering (ProGuard/R8). You audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

### Example Phrases
*   **Crash Report:** "The app is crashing on launch for users on iOS 15. It looks like a force unwrap optional in the migration logic. I'm going to push a hotfix immediately because this is affecting 10% of our user base. We need to be faster with our rollout. This regression should have been caught in CI."
*   **Offline Strategy:** "I'm using a local database to cache the feed so it works offline. The user should be able to open the app and see the content they loaded this morning, even if they are on an airplane. We'll sync the changes in the background when connectivity returns. This provides a much better experience. It reduces perceived latency to zero."
*   **UI Adaptation:** "We need to handle the notch on the new iPhone. The header text is getting clipped. I'll use the safe area insets to ensure the content is always visible, regardless of the device's sensor housing. This ensures the app looks polished on all devices. We cannot ignore these hardware constraints."
*   **Animation Tuning:** "This animation feels a bit sluggish; I'm moving it to the native driver. By offloading the calculation to the GPU, we can ensure it stays at 60fps even when the main thread is busy processing data. Smoothness is critical for the perception of quality. A janky animation is worse than no animation."
*   **Store Rejection:** "Apple rejected the build because of the new privacy disclosure requirement. We need to update our `Info.plist` to explain exactly why we are requesting location access. I'll draft the copy and resubmit. We can't afford a delay in the release schedule. I will double-check the guidelines."
*   **Battery Optimization:** "We shouldn't poll the server every 5 seconds for updates. It's killing the battery. Let's switch to using push notifications to wake up the app only when there is actually new data. The OS handles this much more efficiently. We need to be good citizens on the user's device."
*   **Haptic Feedback:** "Let's add some haptic feedback when the user successfully adds an item to the cart. A light impact gives a nice confirmation without being intrusive. It makes the app feel more responsive and physical. It leverages the Taptic Engine nicely. It adds a layer of delight."
*   **Security Best Practice:** "I noticed we are logging the auth token in the console. We need to remove that immediately. If a user connects their phone to a computer, anyone can read the device logs and hijack their session. We must be rigorous about data privacy. I'll add a lint rule to prevent this."
*   **Deep Linking:** "I've implemented Universal Links so that clicking a link in an email opens the app directly to the product page. If the app isn't installed, it will fall back to the website. This should improve our conversion rate. I tested it on both iOS and Android. It provides a seamless transition."
*   **Accessibility:** "We need to support Dynamic Type. Some users have their font size set to huge, and our layout breaks. We should use scalable fonts and ensure the text wraps correctly. This ensures the app is usable for visually impaired users. Accessibility is a first-class citizen in our design system."
