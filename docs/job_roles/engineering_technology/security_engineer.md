## Job Description
The Security Engineer is responsible for protecting the organization's computer systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. They design and implement security controls, monitor for suspicious activity, and respond to security incidents. They work closely with other engineering teams to ensure that security is built into the software development lifecycle (DevSecOps). They are the guardians of the company's reputation and customer trust.

## Responsibilities

*   **Vulnerability Management:** Identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in the company's software and infrastructure. You run regular vulnerability scans using tools like Nessus or Qualys to find known weaknesses. You triage the findings based on risk and work with engineering teams to prioritize patches. You track the remediation progress and verify that fixes are effective. You stay up to date on new CVEs.
*   **Incident Response:** Detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents and breaches. You analyze logs and forensic evidence to determine the scope and impact of an attack. You contain the threat and eradicate the adversary from the network. You write detailed incident reports and lead the post-incident review to prevent recurrence. You participate in on-call rotation for security emergencies.
*   **Application Security (AppSec):** Secure the company's applications by integrating security checks into the CI/CD pipeline. You perform static (SAST) and dynamic (DAST) application security testing to find bugs early. You conduct code reviews to find flaws like SQL injection and XSS. You train developers on secure coding practices and provide security libraries. You help define security requirements for new features.
*   **Infrastructure Security:** Secure the cloud and on-premise infrastructure from unauthorized access. You manage firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and web application firewalls (WAF). You ensure that servers are hardened according to industry benchmarks (CIS). You manage identity and access management (IAM) policies to enforce least privilege. You monitor configuration changes for security drift.
*   **Compliance and Auditing:** Ensure the organization complies with relevant security standards and regulations (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR). You gather evidence for audits and answer auditor questions. You perform internal audits to verify compliance with internal policies. You maintain security policies and procedures and ensure they are followed. You manage the vendor risk assessment process.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct or coordinate penetration tests to identify weaknesses in the system. You simulate real-world attacks to test the effectiveness of security controls. You verify that reported vulnerabilities are exploitable and assess their business impact. You provide actionable recommendations for remediation. You manage bug bounty programs if applicable.
*   **Threat Modeling:** Work with engineering teams to identify potential threats during the design phase of new features. You analyze the architecture to find security gaps and design flaws. You help teams design security controls to mitigate identified risks effectively. You ensure security is "shifted left" in the development process. You document the threat model and agreed-upon mitigations.
*   **Security Automation:** Automate security tasks to improve efficiency and coverage. You write scripts to automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to prevent unauthorized access. You build tools to automatically remediate common security misconfigurations. You integrate security tools into the developer workflow (e.g., IDE plugins). You create custom alerts for specific threat indicators.
*   **Security Awareness Training:** Educate employees about security best practices and company policies. You run phishing simulations to test user awareness and provide just-in-time training. You conduct security onboarding for new hires to set expectations. You promote a culture of security awareness throughout the organization. You create engaging content to keep security top of mind.
*   **Cryptography and Key Management:** Manage encryption keys and certificates to protect sensitive data. You ensure that sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit using strong algorithms. You design secure key rotation processes to limit the impact of key compromise. You ensure compliance with cryptographic standards (FIPS). You manage the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

### Example Phrases
*   **PR Blocker:** "I'm blocking this PR because of a potential SQL injection vulnerability in the search query. You are concatenating the user input directly into the SQL string. Please use parameterized queries instead to sanitize the input. I've linked the OWASP guide for reference."
*   **Credential Leak:** "We need to rotate these API keys immediately; they were exposed in a public repo. I've already revoked the old keys to prevent unauthorized access. Please update your local environment with the new keys from the secret manager. We need to scrub the git history as well."
*   **WAF Tuning:** "The WAF is blocking legitimate traffic; I'm tuning the rules now. It seems the new marketing campaign is triggering a false positive for cross-site scripting. I'm whitelisting the campaign URL pattern. Service should be restored in 5 minutes."
*   **MFA Enforcement:** "Please enable MFA on your account; it's mandatory. Our policy requires multi-factor authentication for all access to production systems. Without it, you are a single phish away from compromising the network. I can walk you through the setup."
*   **Threat Modeling:** "Let's threat model this new feature before we write any code. I want to understand how data flows between the microservices and where the trust boundaries are. What happens if a malicious user manipulates the ID in the request?"
*   **Vulnerability Priority:** "We need to patch this remote code execution vulnerability on the web server today. It has a CVSS score of 9.8 and is being actively exploited in the wild. Drop everything else. This is a critical security risk."
*   **Phishing Simulation:** "Did you click the link in the 'Free Pizza' email? That was a phishing simulation. It's important to verify the sender address before clicking. We are seeing an uptick in social engineering attacks targeting our team."
*   **Access Review:** "I'm conducting the quarterly access review. Do you still need write access to the billing database? If not, I'm going to remove it to adhere to the principle of least privilege. We need to minimize the blast radius of a potential compromise."
*   **Encryption Standard:** "We cannot store these passwords in plain text. You must use a strong hashing algorithm like Argon2 or bcrypt with a unique salt for each user. Storing plain text passwords is negligent and violates our security policy."
*   **Incident Comms:** "I need everyone to stay off the main channel so the incident response team can coordinate. We have confirmed unauthorized access to the s3 bucket. We are currently containing the breach. I will provide an update to the executive team in 15 minutes."
