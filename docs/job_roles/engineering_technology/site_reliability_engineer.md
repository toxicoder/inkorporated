## Job Description
The Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) combines software engineering and systems operations to build and run large-scale, distributed, fault-tolerant systems. They are responsible for ensuring that the company's services are reliable, scalable, and efficient. They spend their time on operations work (responding to incidents) and development work (automating operations). They are the guardians of production.

## Responsibilities

*   **Incident Response:** Respond to and resolve production incidents to minimize downtime and user impact. You serve as the first line of defense for system outages and performance degradation. You troubleshoot complex issues across the stack, often under time pressure. You lead the incident command process during critical events, coordinating communication and technical efforts. You communicate status updates to stakeholders clearly and calmly.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define, provision, and manage infrastructure using code (Terraform, CloudFormation) to ensure consistency. You ensure that environments are reproducible and can be spun up or down on demand. You automate the provisioning of servers, databases, and networking components to reduce manual toil. You manage configuration drift and enforce state consistency. You version control all infrastructure changes.
*   **Monitoring and Observability:** Build and maintain monitoring systems to track the health of services and infrastructure. You implement dashboards and alerts using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog to provide real-time visibility. You ensure that the team has visibility into system performance and can proactively identify issues. You define Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) to measure reliability. You tune alerts to prevent fatigue.
*   **Capacity Planning:** Analyze system usage patterns and forecast future capacity needs to prevent resource exhaustion. You ensure that the infrastructure can handle traffic spikes (e.g., Black Friday) without degradation. You optimize resource utilization to reduce costs and improve efficiency. You implement auto-scaling policies to dynamic load. You model growth scenarios to inform budgeting.
*   **Reliability Engineering:** Design systems for failure and implement patterns like circuit breakers, retries, and fallbacks. You work with development teams to improve the reliability of their services at the code level. You conduct "Game Days" or Chaos Engineering experiments to test system resilience in controlled environments. You advocate for reliable architecture reviews. You analyze single points of failure.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Management:** Maintain and improve the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines to enable fast and safe releases. You ensure that code can be deployed safely and quickly to production. You implement automated testing, canary deployments, and blue-green deployments in the pipeline. You reduce the time from commit to production. You troubleshoot build failures and optimize build times.
*   **Post-Incident Reviews (PIRs):** Facilitate blameless post-mortems after incidents to learn from failure. You identify the root cause of failures using techniques like "Five Whys". You create actionable items to prevent recurrence and improve system resilience. You foster a culture of learning from mistakes rather than assigning blame. You publish reports to the wider engineering organization.
*   **Toil Reduction:** Identify and automate repetitive, manual operational tasks ("toil") to free up engineering time. You write scripts and tools to eliminate human error and save time. You aim to keep operational work below 50% of your time, dedicating the rest to engineering projects. You enable self-service for developers to perform common tasks. You document runbooks for tasks that cannot be fully automated.
*   **Security Operations:** Implement security best practices in the infrastructure to protect against threats. You manage access controls (IAM) and secrets management (Vault) to enforce least privilege. You ensure that servers are patched and hardened against vulnerabilities. You monitor for security threats and anomalous behavior. You work with the security team to implement compliance controls.
*   **On-Call Rotation:** Participate in a 24/7 on-call rotation to support critical services and ensure availability. You ensure that alerts are actionable and not just noise to prevent burnout. You help improve the on-call experience for the team by refining runbooks and tools. You are available to jump on issues when they arise, day or night. You swap shifts with teammates when needed.

### Example Phrases
*   **Error Budget Concern:** "What's our error budget looking like for this quarter? If we burn through it, we freeze deploys. We are currently at 80% consumption with two weeks left. We need to prioritize stability fixes over new features until the budget resets. This is the agreement we made with product."
*   **Automation Proposal:** "Let's automate this recovery process so we don't get paged at 3 AM for a known issue. This is the third time this week the worker node has hung. I can write a watchdog script to detect the stall and restart the process automatically. This fits our philosophy of eliminating toil."
*   **Capacity Warning:** "We need to scale up the database before the marketing launch; the current instance type won't handle the connection count. Based on the projected traffic of 10k concurrent users, we will hit the connection limit in the first hour. I recommend resizing to a `db.r5.4xlarge` and enabling connection pooling."
*   **Incident Declaration:** "I'm declaring an incident; let's move this conversation to the dedicated war room channel. I'm assuming the role of Incident Commander. Can someone please verify user impact while I check the load balancer logs? Let's keep the comms clear and focused on mitigation."
*   **Alert Tuning:** "This alert is too noisy; we need to tune the threshold to avoid alert fatigue. It's paging us for CPU spikes that resolve themselves in seconds. I suggest we change the trigger to a 5-minute moving average > 80%. If it's not actionable, it shouldn't be a page."
*   **Root Cause Inquiry:** "We need to identify the root cause, not just the symptoms; let's dig into the kernel logs. Restarting the server fixed it for now, but why did it crash? I suspect an OOM (Out of Memory) killer event. Unless we fix the memory leak, it will happen again."
*   **Stress Testing:** "Have we stress-tested this new service? I want to know its breaking point before we ship to production. I'm going to run a load test using K6 to see how it behaves under 2x peak load. We need to verify that the rate limiting kicks in correctly."
*   **IaC Mandate:** "Infrastructure as Code is the only way; if it's not in Terraform, it doesn't exist. Please do not make manual changes in the AWS console. It causes configuration drift and makes disaster recovery impossible. Update the TF file and apply it through the pipeline."
*   **Resilience Pattern:** "We need to implement a circuit breaker here to prevent cascading failures. If the recommendation service is down, the product page should still load, just without recommendations. Failing the entire request because of a non-critical dependency is poor reliability engineering."
*   **Timeline Reconstruction:** "Let's review the timeline of events to understand exactly when the latency started spiking. I see a deployment finished at 14:02, and the error rate climbed at 14:05. This strong correlation suggests the new build is the culprit. Let's diff the changes."
