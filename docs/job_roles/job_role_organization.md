# 1. Executive Summary


**What's on this page**

- Role-specific guidance, responsibilities, and agent profile for Inkorporated.
- Practical guidance, roles, or standards as applicable.

**What this enables**

- Consistent hiring and execution standards
- Shared language for humans and cyborg agents

This document defines the standard organizational architecture for Inkorporated. We utilize a Matrix Organizational Structure, designed to balance deep functional expertise with rapid cross-functional execution.
 
 * Functional Departments (Verticals): Where talent is hired, trained, and managed (e.g., Engineering, Finance).
 * Specialized Squads (Horizontals): Where work actually gets done. These are cross-functional teams composed of members from various departments to deliver specific business value (e.g., "Mobile Platform Squad").

# 2. Visual Org Chart (The Matrix Model)

The following diagram illustrates how functional departments (blue) supply talent to execution squads (orange).
